      <p>We've been working with a coffee roaster in San Jose to come up with our own espresso coffee - blended and roasted to our specifications to produce authentic Roman-style espresso drinks.</p>
      <p>We chose only 100% arabica beans because they are far more flavorful than the cheaper beans used in most grocery store coffees.</p>
      <p>We blended the smooth, rich flavors of Africa with the subtle sweetness of Latin American beans to produce coffee with a smooth flavor and tempting aroma.</p></div>
